OSX-iCal-Fix
============

This is a fix I created about 3 years that fixes timezone issues between iCal events sent by Exchange Server to Apple iCal. There is a problem with certain versions of Exchange where it offsets the meeting time due to compatibility issues with timezone support. This fixes this issue.
